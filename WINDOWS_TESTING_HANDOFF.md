# Windows Testing Handoff - .NET Tools Bridge

## üìã Mission: Validate Windows Platform Integration

The **.NET Tools Bridge extension** has been **fully developed and tested on macOS** with a comprehensive installation assistant system and **updated extension prioritization strategy**. **Your mission is to validate it works correctly on Windows** with real Visual Studio installations and Windsurf.

## üÜï Recent Updates & Changes

### **üéØ Major Changes Since Last Test:**
1. **‚úÖ Rebranded to ".NET Tools Bridge"** - All UI, commands, and output channels updated
2. **‚úÖ Fixed OmniSharp Path Detection** - No longer finds directories instead of executables  
3. **‚úÖ Added Cancellable Installations** - Users can cancel hanging operations
4. **‚úÖ Prioritized Open VSX Extensions** - muhammad-sammy C# extension recommended first
5. **‚úÖ Enhanced Roslyn Detection** - Better search in VS Extensions directories
6. **‚úÖ Improved Error Handling** - Better user feedback and recovery

### **üîß New Extension Priority Order:**
1. **C# Extension (muhammad-sammy)** - Open VSX preferred 
2. **Microsoft C# Extension** - Official fallback
3. **Standalone OmniSharp** - Command-line last resort

## üéØ What We've Built

### **Core Achievement: Smart Installation Assistant**

- **Prioritizes Open VSX extensions** over Microsoft marketplace
- **Provides cancellable installations** with proper progress feedback
- **Offers multiple installation paths** ranked by preference and compatibility
- **One-click setup experience** instead of cryptic "tool not found" errors

### **Key Features to Test:**
1. **Real Platform Detection**: Should detect Windows platform and find Visual Studio installations
2. **Smart Extension Recommendations**: Should prioritize muhammad-sammy C# extension
3. **Installation Assistant**: Should offer to install missing tools with user-friendly prompts
4. **Provider Integration**: Should properly activate Roslyn/OmniSharp language servers
5. **UI Components**: Activity bar, tree views, and commands should work correctly
6. **Cross-platform Commands**: All commands should execute without errors

## üñ•Ô∏è Windows Testing Environment Setup

### **Prerequisites:**
1. **Windows machine** (Windows 10/11)
2. **Visual Studio** installed (any edition: Community, Professional, Enterprise)
3. **Windsurf** installed (primary target) or VS Code (fallback)
4. **.NET SDK** (6.0+ recommended)
5. **Git** for cloning the repository

### **Quick Setup:**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd ms-tool-bridge

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile TypeScript
npm run compile

# Verify build succeeded
npm test
```

## üß™ Critical Test Scenarios

### **Test 1: Extension Activation & New Branding**
**Goal:** Verify Windows platform service works correctly with new branding

1. **Open project in Windsurf**
2. **Press F5** to launch Extension Development Host
3. **Check Output Panel** (".NET Tools Bridge" channel - **NOT** "VS Tools Bridge")
4. **Verify logs show:**
   ```
   .NET Tools Bridge is activating...
   Platform: windows
   Found X VS installations:
     - Visual Studio [Edition] [Year]
   ```

**‚úÖ Expected Result:** Platform detected as 'windows', real VS installations found, new branding visible  
**‚ùå Failure Signs:** Old "VS Tools Bridge" branding, platform shows 'mac', no VS installations, or errors

### **Test 2: Updated Installation Assistant - Extension Priority**
**Goal:** Test the new extension prioritization strategy

1. **Fresh extension activation** (or manually run setup)
2. **Wait 2-3 seconds** after activation
3. **Run command:** ".NET Tools Bridge: Check Missing Tools"
4. **Should prioritize in this order:**
   - C# Extension (muhammad-sammy) - **FIRST RECOMMENDATION**
   - Microsoft C# Extension - fallback
   - Standalone OmniSharp - last resort

**‚úÖ Expected Result:** muhammad-sammy extension recommended first, clear installation guidance  
**‚ùå Failure Signs:** Wrong priority order, missing recommendations, or old OmniSharp-only suggestions

### **Test 3: Cancellable Installation Progress**
**Goal:** Test the new cancellable installation feature

**Setup:** Ensure OmniSharp is not installed globally
```bash
# Check if OmniSharp is installed
dotnet tool list -g | findstr omnisharp

# If installed, uninstall for testing
dotnet tool uninstall -g omnisharp
```

**Test Steps:**
1. **Run command:** ".NET Tools Bridge: Check Missing Tools"
2. **Should detect:** Missing C# language support
3. **Click "Install All" or select OmniSharp** option
4. **During installation:** Should show **cancellable progress dialog**
5. **Test cancellation:** Click cancel button and verify graceful handling

**‚úÖ Expected Result:** Installation shows cancel button, cancellation works properly  
**‚ùå Failure Signs:** No cancel button, hanging installations, or crash on cancel

### **Test 4: Enhanced Visual Studio Integration**
**Goal:** Test improved VS detection and Roslyn integration

1. **Check tree view:** .NET Tools Bridge activity bar ‚Üí Tool Paths
2. **Should show:**
   - Visual Studio installations found
   - MSBuild paths for each VS version  
   - Enhanced Roslyn language server search results
3. **Try building a project:** Right-click project ‚Üí Build Project
4. **Check providers:** .NET Tools Bridge ‚Üí Providers ‚Üí Should show Roslyn availability

**‚úÖ Expected Result:** Real VS installations detected, improved Roslyn search, builds work  
**‚ùå Failure Signs:** No VS detected, Roslyn unavailable despite VS installation, build failures

### **Test 5: Updated Command Palette Integration**
**Goal:** Test all commands work with new branding

**Commands to test:** (Ctrl+Shift+P) - **ALL should start with ".NET Tools Bridge:"**
- `.NET Tools Bridge: Setup Wizard`
- `.NET Tools Bridge: Check Missing Tools` 
- `.NET Tools Bridge: Install .NET Tools`
- `.NET Tools Bridge: Build Project`
- `.NET Tools Bridge: Select Visual Studio Version`
- `.NET Tools Bridge: Restart Language Server`

**‚úÖ Expected Result:** All commands show new branding, execute without errors, show appropriate dialogs  
**‚ùå Failure Signs:** Old "VS Tools Bridge" naming, commands missing, errors on execution

### **Test 6: Windsurf-Specific Testing**
**Goal:** Ensure extension works properly in Windsurf (primary target)

1. **Test in Windsurf specifically** (not just VS Code)
2. **Check extension marketplace integration**
3. **Verify Open VSX extension recommendations work**
4. **Test that Extension Development Host launches correctly**
5. **Confirm all features work the same as in VS Code**

**‚úÖ Expected Result:** Full functionality in Windsurf environment  
**‚ùå Failure Signs:** Features missing in Windsurf, marketplace issues, extension host problems

## üîç Updated Windows Validation Points

### **Windows Platform Service (`WindowsPlatformService.ts`)**

   - **NEW:** Should search recursively in Extensions directories
   - Should detect Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.LanguageServer.exe
   - Should support different VS editions (Community, Professional, Enterprise)

### **Updated Installation Assistant Logic:**
1. **Extension-First Strategy** - Should prioritize VS Code/Windsurf extensions
2. **Open VSX Priority** - Should recommend muhammad-sammy extension first
3. **Clear Fallback Chain** - Should provide multiple options with explanations

## üÜö Changes from Previous Version

| What Changed | Old Behavior | New Behavior |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Branding** | "VS Tools Bridge" everywhere | ".NET Tools Bridge" everywhere |
| **Extension Priority** | OmniSharp standalone only | muhammad-sammy ‚Üí Microsoft ‚Üí OmniSharp |
| **Installation UX** | Non-cancellable | Cancellable with progress |
| **Target Editor** | VS Code focus | Windsurf primary, VS Code fallback |
| **OmniSharp Detection** | Found directories | Finds actual executables |
