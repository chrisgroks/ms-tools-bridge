# VS Tools Bridge - Value Proposition

## What Problem Does This Solve?

**.NET Framework development in VS Code is fragmented and painful.** Developers need to:

- Install multiple separate extensions that don't talk to each other
- Manually configure paths for MSBuild, language servers, and debuggers
- Switch between different tools for different .NET Framework versions
- Deal with inconsistent behavior across Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Troubleshoot when tools can't find each other or Visual Studio components

**VS Tools Bridge solves this by providing a unified, intelligent bridge between VS Code and .NET tooling.**

## Core Value Propositions

### 1. **Unified Tool Management**
**Instead of:** Installing 5+ separate extensions (C#, MSBuild, debugger, etc.) and hoping they work together  
**VS Tools Bridge:** Single extension that detects, configures, and coordinates all .NET tools automatically

### 2. **Intelligent Auto-Detection + Installation**
**Instead of:** Manually configuring paths to MSBuild, Roslyn, OmniSharp, Visual Studio installations  
**VS Tools Bridge:** Automatically finds, configures, AND INSTALLS the best available tools for your system

### 3. **Cross-Platform Consistency**
**Instead of:** Different workflows on Windows vs macOS vs Linux  
**VS Tools Bridge:** Consistent experience across all platforms with platform-specific optimizations

### 4. **Provider Flexibility**
**Instead of:** Being locked into one language server (OmniSharp OR Roslyn)  
**VS Tools Bridge:** Choose the best provider for your needs, switch easily, fallback gracefully

#### **3. What Gets Installed Automatically:**
- **OmniSharp:** `dotnet tool install -g omnisharp` (one command, fully automatic)
- **Mono (macOS):** Guided Homebrew installation with automatic detection
- **VS Code C# Extension:** Direct links and installation guidance

#### **4. Real-World Example (macOS):**
```
‚ùå Before: "OmniSharp not found" ‚Üí User confused, gives up

```

### **This Delivers REAL Value:**
Instead of users seeing errors and giving up, they get **actionable solutions** that work with one click. The extension now truly **transforms VS Code into a professional .NET development environment** by ensuring users have the tools they need, not just detecting what they don't have.

**This is the difference between "detects tools" and "gets you set up to succeed."**
